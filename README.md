# Assignments
Various school programs

First Assignment Section (Implementation of linked list functionality)

This program has a main.cpp file, a functions.cpp file, and a header.h file.
After running the main.cpp, the program will ask the user which function to use (on a dynamic array) via a menu. For 
functions that require input, such as push_front(), it will ask the user to give one (or more) values.

Below are three screenshots of output.
The first is using push_front to add 2 to the list, then checking to see if the list is empty, and finally getting 
the position index of the value 2, by using the size_tfind function.

The second is a screenshot of the array printed out, after inserting 56 into position 7 with the insert function, and 
using the front function to output the value 2, which is still at the front of the array.

Second Assignment Section (Stack using a vector)

This program simply has a main file, and implements a stack using a vector. Below is a screenshot showing that 
the stack is empty. Behind the output, a 4,8,12, and 16 are added, then 16 is popped off and the top value is outputed. 
Finally, the average of the stack items is outputted.
